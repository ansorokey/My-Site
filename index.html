    <h2>I'm Anton.
        <br>
        Welcome to my personal website
    </h2>
    <p>I'm on a journey to become a web developer and software engineer.
        A lot of my time is spent studying and taking notes.
        One day I thought to myself: <i>Why am I writing notes...when I could be <b>applying</b> notes!</i>
        So this website will be my own little space to shape and mold with the knowledge I gain along my journey.
        Part notes, part blog, part collection of useful resources, and so on.
    </p>


    <h2>Why programming?</h2>
    <p>I've always had an interest in technology.</p>

    <h2>What then?</h2>
    <p>landing a job as a programmer is only the beginning. I plan to do a lot afterwards! A comfortable position with a decent salary will allow me to start saving up for a home. Why a home? Because I'd like to be a foster parent one day!</p>
